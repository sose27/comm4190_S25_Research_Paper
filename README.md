# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Research Project

### Overview

This project explores the intersection of Mood Management Theory (MMT) and large language models (LLMs) to understand how AI can engage with and potentially influence human emotional states. MMT, developed by Dolf Zillmann in the 1980s, posits that people use media to regulate their mood, seeking content that aligns with their emotional needs based on factors like excitatory potential, absorption potential, semantic affinity, and hedonic valence. With the rise of AI-driven communication, this project examines how LLMs might incorporate MMT principles to provide more emotionally attuned responses, potentially transforming the way humans interact with technology. The paper includes a small-scale experiment that tests whether LLMs like Claude can generate responses consistent with MMT's predictions for different emotional states.
